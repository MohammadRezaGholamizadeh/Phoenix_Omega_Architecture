# Phoenix_Creativity_Architecture
This architecture was created and designed by me (MohammadReza Gholamizadeh[Phoenix]), and it is a new software development architecture that combines the following architectures to incorporate the capabilities of most software architectures into itself. This architecture is called the Phoenix Creativity Architecture.

Layered Architecture
Event-Driven Architecture
Service-Oriented Architecture
Message-Oriented Middleware Architecture
Microservices Architecture
Hierarchical Architecture
Distributed Architecture
Parallel Computing Architecture
Cloud Computing Architecture
Clean Architecture
Onion Architecture
Hexagonal Architecture

The aim is to incorporate all the capabilities and benefits of these architectures into this new architecture while adhering to the majority of software design principles.
